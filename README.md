# A list of topics I want to learn over winter 2022/2023

### Goals

1. K-Means
2. K-Nearest Neighbors
3. Decision Trees
4. Basic Neural Network
5. With backpropogation
6. Convolutional Neural Networks
7. Recurrent Neural Networks
8. Generative Adversarial Networks

## Setup Instructions

1. Install python3
2. Install Rust
3. Activate python virtual environment (platform dependent)
4. Install dependencies from requirements.txt
5. Install jupyter notebook/jupyter lab
6. Open notebooks in jupyter notebook/jupyter lab

\*\* Note

K-Means-Clustering.ipynb uses evcxr which is purely in rust. The rest of the notebook is in python.

This is due to how slow dependencies installed in evcxr everytime the notebook was opened (even with caching enabled).

EVCXR is a very cool project though!
